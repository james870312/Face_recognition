recommend use linux ubuntu18.04 (my OS)
you can delete the old "build" in this directory
into the "609415159_hw3" directory and Create folder name "build"
into build and run instruction:
	cmake ..
	make install
and into build/install/bin
run"./Depth_of_field  Calibration_data/left13.png" or "./Face_recognition"

if do not want to these method, you can catch main.cpp also
it in in 609415159_hw3/util/Depth_of_field/main.cpp
	609415159_hw3/util/Face_recognition/main.cpp
